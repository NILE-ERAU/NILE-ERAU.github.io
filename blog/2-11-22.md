## 2-11-22: Machine Learning moving faster than the truck with our parts :(

This week we have continued to eagerly wait for our off-the-shelf parts to arrive. The good news is that we have received confirmation of our order completion and we expect to get a shipping confirmation email in the next few days!  

With no delivery yet, we have continued to march on! We have learned how to operate more new machines to fabricate our custom parts to an accuracy within our tolerances, specifically lathes and mills. In addition, the mechanical team has worked hard to assemble what we can to while off-the-shelf parts are in transit. Below is a photo of what we call the “mailbox” which happened to be one of the most complicated to assemble – this houses the motor and gearbox that will drive the wheels.

In terms of software, research on advanced machine learning with convolutional neural networks is completed! Image datasets are being compiled to begin training a custom neural network, some example photos can be seen below:

We are very excited about the progress being made in the software department of our capstone and are eager to see more results from this algorithm in the coming weeks!  

Concerning electrical progress, we had another productive week which consisted of constructing harnesses, tabling, further calculations on power distribution both in the fuse boxes and across cables. We’re anticipating our custom PCB’s will arrive first thing next week!
