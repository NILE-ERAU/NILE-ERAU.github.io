## 10-29-21: Specification Part 3
This last week has been spent critiquing other team's specification documents and planning out the rest of the semester, as well as devoting some time to maintaining a good level of communication.

The critique of the other team's documents has been aimed at helpful ideas, typo notices, and congratulations on well-done pieces of work.  Though our team sometimes disagrees on suggestions for improvement all of our peers were able to provide much helpful feedback.

We had a team meeting to discuss our team dynamic and assess whether our idea of a team with no leader is still viable.  With some input from Dr. Chesley we unanimously agreed that the team is working well, though improvement could be seen in making sure each member gets to say their full piece before critique or counterargument.

The planning of the remainder of the semester and prep for deliverables at the end of it went well.  So well in fact that we are ahead of schedule and beginning on next week's work.   We have layed out our organizational scheme for documents and files and have moved on to picking parts and assigned prototype designs.
