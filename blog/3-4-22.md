## 3-4-22: Published Authors!

This week, unlike last week, has been full of time in the lab! Exciting progress has been made both on the actual robot and on our submission for the IEEE SusTech conference 2022. We have officially sent in the definitive version of our document to be published. We have also gone through the process of applying for the College of Engineering fund for excellence which we were approved for which will fund our author fees for the conference.

On other news, we have finished building the mechanical assembly! The last parts of the robot to have been assembled included the end-effector and lead screw mechanism. The lead screw mechanism proved to be a little tricky when it comes to order of assembly with the end effector. However, the dedication and determined nature of the team meant that this did not take too long! All efforts from the mechanical team move to electrical integration and mechatronic system integration from this point forward.

Every part of the robot has power as of Wednesday this week, and most of the wiring is complete! Software continues to move steadily along with another research-intensive week. The progress made at the start of the semester has given us plenty of time to work on the machine learning algorithms going forward, making our robot more effective at plant classification and plant care.

We hope to have a moving robot by the very start of next week! Check back next Friday to hear how that goes!
