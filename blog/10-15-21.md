## 10-15-21: Specifications - Part 1

Over the last few weeks, we have created requirements, morphological charts, and CAD models for our design. This week, the day before Fall Break, we began discussing our specifications. 

As we began discussing our specifications, we figured out that our requirement for Application Efficiency needed to be reworked. Our requirement did not ensure that the plant was being watered and kept alive. We discussed the possibility of adding a new requirement to ensure that the plant is being watered properly. Once everyone returns from Fall Break, we will be able continue our discussion.

For our other requirements, we began to work on general outlines for our specifications. We added the outlines for the specifications under the related requirements. Some examples of our specification outlines would be the resolution of the end effector position, the voltage of the parasite elimination end effector, and the amount of time the system can maintain an IP55 rating. 

Weâ€™re excited to have moved on to this part of the design process, but we still have a lot to discuss!
