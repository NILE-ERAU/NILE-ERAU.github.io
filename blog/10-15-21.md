## 10-15-21: Specifications - Part 1

Over the last few weeks, we have created requirements, morphological charts, and CAD models of our conceptual design. This week, the day before Fall Break, we began discussing our specifications. 
 
One of our major realizations was that our requirement for application efficiency needed to be reworked as it did not ensure that the plant was being watered and kept alive. Once everyone returns from Fall Break, we will be able to continue our discussion. 
 
For our other requirements, we began to work on general outlines for the specifications. Examples include the end-effector position resolution, voltage of the parasite elimination end-effector, and time the system must maintain an IP55 rating. 
 
Weâ€™re excited to have moved on to this part of the design process, but we still have a lot to discuss!
