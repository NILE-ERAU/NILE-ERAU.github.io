## 9-24-21: Conceptual Design Part 1

Things have been humming along here at NILE as we slowly tease out a conceptual design for our system.

But first, we started off the week by presenting a snapshot of our research into the dire agricultural situation in the western United States. A lack of water is already hurting Californian [farmers](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/what-does-never-ending-drought-mean-california-agriculture) and studies show that climate change will only make things [worse](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96243-5).

Lucky we are not the first and certainly won’t be the last to tackle this issue. From small scale [microfarming](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e0/97/e5/9431fe6f88afa9/US20140168412A1.pdf) and [backyard](https://farm.bot/) automation all the way to swarms of [airships](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c3/01/23/7a528443ab8654/US9852644.pdf) there are _interesting_ mechanical design abound. Furthermore, there have been significant advancements in machine learning allowing systems to [identify](https://publiclab.org/notes/petter_mansson1/04-09-2019/low-cost-ndvi-analysis-using-raspberrypi-and-pinoir) plants and [protect](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8437085) them all without human input.

Later in the week, we started work individual conceptual designs to get everyone’s best ideas before deciding upon the design we will work on for the next six months. As we did this, a big focus was on how the software and hardware can work in union to care for crops dynamically, as conditions change.

We can’t wait to show off our conceptual designs, but you’ll just have to wait for next week!
