## 10-22-21: Specifications - Part 2

This past week has consisted of writing specifications for our requirements. Itâ€™s been a long journey from the initial problem statement to our conceptual design but with these specifications, the path forward is becoming increasingly clear.

We approached these specifications in a fairly methodical manner, moving chronologically through the requirements list. We crafted concise, testable specifications to guide the design as we move closer to a preliminary design. Once a final product is reached, we can use the specifications to prove our design meets the goals required to solve the overall problem. 
 
This Friday we gave a presentation on our specifications and received fantastic feedback. We will make the necessary changes and upload our finalized specifications document to the website early next week.  
 
As for what is coming... we are finally commencing our preliminary design work! The team is extremely excited and hopeful for the coming weeks of this project and eagerly looks forward to updating you all on our work as we go!
