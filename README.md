## Welcome to NILE

Conventional agricultural methods overcompensate plant and soil needs through wasteful watering practices and excessive application of pesticides and fertilizers, leading to substantial environmental damage. This damage takes on various forms, including pollution via runoff, soil depletion, and the extinction of local pollinators.

This is where the NILE project comes in. Through our unique, robotic approach to agriculture we aim to precisely care for, and monitor the health of, various crops.
